A few days ago I released version 0.0.5 of the [MiniTest
Cookbook](https://github.com/fujin/minitest-cookbook) which included a
feature I've been working on that allows you to build MiniTest unit
test cases programmaticaly throughout the Chef run and have them
executed by a dedicated test runner.

I've also retained the ability to run via Vagrant, for ease of
testing. The develop branch has some more recent enhancmenets, notably
an in-line Sinatra server which I'm building example test cases
around.

Test all the fucking time.
