My name is Arjuna Christensen. I'm a systems engineer.

I once worked at Opscode as a systems development engineer where I was
able to work on Chef. Since then, I've kept my blades sharp by
deploying resilient infrastructure worldwide.

In my spare time I like to make drumstep, dubstep & drum'n'bass;
delving into the world of glitch hop too. Bass music is where it's at.
